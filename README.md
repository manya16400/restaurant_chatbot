# Restaurant_chatbot

Developed a chatbot that can work with the knowledge base using <b>Dialogflow</b>. 

### Steps 
1. A knowledge base is created using the beta feature of Dialogflow 
2. Inside the KB, a document is added of knowledge type "Extractive Question Answering" which contains the descriptive text of the chatbot (text/plain) as data.
3. The KB did not give effective results, so next intents are added.
4. Created varous intents which contains the most likely questions the user can ask and its respective responses. 
5. At last training and testing is done.
